## A brief introduction about "data"

Data is a value stored in the computer's memory. It's possible to represent 256 different combinations with just 8 bits.
The number `45` is compatible to `101101` (base-2 or binary).

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
**_NOTE_**: `32 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 45`
